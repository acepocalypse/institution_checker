    "\n",
    "### Quick Start (3 steps):\n",
    "1. **🔄 RELOAD** (Cell 10): Load all fixes ⭐\n",
    "2. **Configure** (Cell 4): Set INPUT_MODE and names\n",
    "3. **Run Pipeline** (Cell 9): Process all names\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Workflow:\n",
    "1. **Setup** → Cell 3: Import modules\n",
    "2. **Configure** → Cell 4: Set input and parameters\n",
    "3. **Resolve Names** → Cell 7: Validate name list\n",
    "4. **🔄 RELOAD MODULE** → Cell 10: Load fixes ⭐ **START HERE**\n",
    "5. **🔬 Diagnose** → Cell 13: Verify LLM is working correctly\n",
    "6. **Debug Single** → Cell 15: Test problematic names\n",
    "7. **Run Pipeline** → Cell 9: Process all names\n",
    "8. **Quality Check** → Cell 19: Analyze results\n",
    "9. **Retry Failed** → Cell 17: Auto-retry any remaining errors\n",
    "10. **Export** → Cell 22: Save to Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 What Was Fixed:\n",
    "- ✅ **REMOVED max_tokens** - unlimited for thinking models\n",
    "- ✅ **Fixed format string error** - escaped curly braces\n",
    "- ✅ **IMPROVED current/past detection** - smarter signal counting\n",
    "- ✅ **Enhanced prompt** - clearer temporal guidance\n",
    "- ✅ **Fixed temperature** (0.0) - consistent reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Current/Past Detection Logic:\n",
    "**Simple, evidence-based approach:**\n",
    "- Counts \"current\" terms (is, currently, works at) vs \"past\" terms (was, former, retired)\n",
    "- Detects ended date ranges like \"2010-2015\"\n",
    "- Checks if person is currently at another institution\n",
    "- Overrides LLM classification when evidence is strong (3+ signals)"
